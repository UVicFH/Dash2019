# Dash2019

The purpose of this repository is to store the code and design files for the 2019 competition dash.

The newest CANduino revision will be used and the dash enclosure will house only a small PCB for the CANduino.

The project proposal, BOM, and other documentation can be found in the drive in Electrical/2018-2019/DASH
